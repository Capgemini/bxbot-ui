# BX-bot UI
An Angular app (and learning project!) for administering [BX-bot](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot).

Coming soon...

## Credits
This app started life as the [Angular 2 QuickStart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) app and took (a lot of)
inspiration from the following awesomeness:

* The official [Angular Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).
* Scotch tutorials by [Jecelyn Yeen](https://pub.scotch.io/@jecelyn).
* [Juri Strumpflohner's](http://juristr.com/blog/collections/angular-2/) Angular blogs.
* Blog posts by [Thoughtram](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/09/15/angular-2-final-is-out.html).
