# BX-bot UI (Angular 2 Sample App)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Capgemini/bxbot-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Capgemini/bxbot-ui)
    
A learning project and simple Angular 2 sample app.
 
It is a cut-down version of [BX-bot UI](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot-ui).

Very much work in progress, but this is where we're [heading](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot-ui/projects/1)...

## Credits
This app started life as the [Angular 2 QuickStart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) app and took (a lot of)
inspiration from the following awesomeness:

* The official [Angular Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).
* Scotch tutorials by [Jecelyn Yeen](https://pub.scotch.io/@jecelyn).
* [Juri Strumpflohner's](http://juristr.com/blog/collections/angular-2/) Angular blogs.
* Blog posts by [Thoughtram](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/09/15/angular-2-final-is-out.html).
